# split by sequence
# just parse new annotations to separate sequence
# can scratch or finetune
# if scratch
both train and val 
bdd2yolo --bdd-file accept <path/to/train/or/val>
# if fintune, train accept new seq data only, keepval accept whole

# trining result naming can defined by seq, scratch means use all seqs before and including the named sequence, fine tune means use only named sequence
